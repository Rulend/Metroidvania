# Metroidvania
A metroidvania using 3D assets in a 2D perspective. 

I've used this project to try out some systems such as different types of interactables and an inventory system optimized for both controllers and mouse + keyboard. 

Currently on hiatus as I finish up some other projects and learn things that aren't really fit for this project due to its 2D-focused gameplay.
